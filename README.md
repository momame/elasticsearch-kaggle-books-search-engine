# elasticsearch-kaggle-books-search-engine
This repository contains code for a powerful search engine demo that can search through 7,000 books in just two minutes using Elasticsearch and Docker. The demo uses the Kaggle 7k books dataset as an example and walks you through the process of indexing the data and querying it with Elasticsearch. Whether you're a developer, data scientist, or just curious about the potential of Elasticsearch and Docker, this demo is a great place to start.

The Python code in this repository connects to Elasticsearch, defines the index mapping, creates the 'books' index, and indexes the data from the 'books.csv' file. You can use this code as a starting point for building your own Elasticsearch and Docker search engine.

Keywords: Elasticsearch, Docker, search engine, Kaggle, 7k books, indexing, querying, data science, development, demo, Python.

In short, this code provides a simple and efficient way to build a search engine that can search through large datasets with ease using Elasticsearch and Docker. The code is well-commented and easy to follow, making it a great resource for anyone interested in learning more about Elasticsearch and Docker.
